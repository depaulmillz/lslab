# LSlab

Designed in "KVCG: A Heterogeneous Key-Value Store for Skewed Workloads" by dePaul Miller, Jacob Nelson, Ahmed Hassan, and Roberto Palmieri."

## Building

Requires CMake 3.18 and Conan.

Get CMake from kitware and Conan from your favorite python package manager.

## Clang Support

Clang seems to have an issue compiling the code that makes the tests fail.
I am not going to fix this as of this moment unless necessary.
