abstract = {We present KVCG, a novel heterogeneous key-value store whose primary objective is to serve client requests targeting frequently accessed (hot) keys at sub-millisecond latency and requests targeting less frequently accessed (cold) keys with high throughput. To accomplish this goal, KVCG deploys an architecture where requests on hot keys are routed to a software cache operated by CPU threads, while the remainder are offloaded to a data repository optimized for execution on modern GPU devices. Cold/hot partitioning is done at runtime through a model trained with the incoming workload. Against a state-of-the-art competitor, we obtain up to 34x improvement in latency.},
